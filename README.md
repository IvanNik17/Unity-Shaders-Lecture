# Unity-Shaders-Lecture
Shader Graph shader examples for the course Real-Time Computer Graphics

The project contains 16 shaders of various difficulty implemented in shader graph. The shaders are based on the work of Daniel Ilett described in thier videos [10 Shaders in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vje0x1BNpp8&t=64s) and PolyToots described in their video [Unity: Bulge, Grow and Deform with Shader Graph!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T8cKTQrMxk&t=1s).

The Unity project is separated into two Scenes - one with 6 vertex shaders and one with 10 various simpler shaders. Each shader is represented with a material on a sphere or a 3D mesh with the same name as the shader.

The project is made using Unity 2022.3.9f1 and use the URP rendering pipeline. The shaders should work without a problem in the Built-in rendering pipeline, after the shader graph library is added.

Free assets and textures are used from PolyHaven
